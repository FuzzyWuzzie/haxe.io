# Haxe Roundup № 217

There are two upcoming events, Gamedev101 [Level1][l16] by [Dan Hett][tw5] which is
an introduction to the fundamentals of videos game using Stencyl and
[FOSDEM 2015][l17] which [Elliott Stoneham][tw6] has taken upon himself to
organise a bunch of Haxe users to attend and talk. _I will create an events page
for FOSDEM 2015_.

Flambe `4.1.0` was [released][l2] last weekend, with `4.0.0` users encouraged to upgrade.
Just run `flambe update` to get it. Checkout the [changelog][l3] for a full list of new
features.

[Mark Knol][tw1] has published a Flambe [snippet][l1] which shows you how to affect
gameplay elements to be triggered on a heartbeat, using new features from Flambe
`4.1.0`.

In last weeks [Haxe Roundup № 216][l7], [Jacob Albano][tw3] said he was close to 
releasing Iridescence, well he was and has released [Iridescence][l8] which is now
available on from [itch.io][l8].

[Nico][gh1] has [open sourced][l4] his Twitter retweet bot [HaxeBot][tw2], targeting
Java and using [Twitter4J][l5] along with Haxe's `-java-lib` which makes using native
libraries easy.

Nico has also returned to regular development on [IceEntity][l6], a _“simple framework
for managing entities, components and runtime scripts in HaxeFlixel”_, which is now at
version `1.2.0`, which provides a cleaner API for accessing runtime scripts variables
and methods.

![lawnman](/img/217/lawn.mp4 "Get off my lawn! by Nico and @SruloArt")

I think this is awesome, [Steve Richey][tw4] has created a _“glitch”_ library which
uses JPEG compression wrongly to accomplish an interesting effect which came out of
his LD30 game [MESSENGNR][l9] and now available on [GitHub][l10].

[Vadim][p1] has been [sharing][l11] previews of his [marching squares][l12] and 
polygonal lighting experiments he has been working on, which uses Haxe, 
OpenFL and OpenFL-Bitive.

![marching](/img/217/marching.mp4 "Polygonal editing")

[Franco Ponticelli][gh2] has released [demo][l13] of his latest library [thx.stream][l14]
and [thx.stream.dom][l15] showing you how to react to data over time, easily and
crossplatform.

For all of us who don't understand shaders, but want to, [Sven Bergström][tw7] has released
the second part of his tutorial series, but first checkout [Primer: Shaders][l19], then
head over to [Shaders: second stage][l20].

[Tilman Schmidt][tw8] has modified [Nico's][gh1] SlickRock FlashDevelop theme, called
[Seaweed][l21].

[Darek Zieliński][tw9] has released the source for his GameBoy Jam entry [GrayScale][l22]
onto GitHub which came 7th out of 245 games. The game was made using Haxe, OpenFL and 
HaxeFlixel and you can play it [online][l23].

[Oscar's][gh3] [nxColor][l24] colour manipulation library now has experimental
colour blindness and golden ratio tests available.

[David Elahee][tw10] has added `.pvr` support to [heaps][l25] which is apparently
useful for mobile and console developers.

And to finish [HaxeStudio][tw11] `0.4.4` has been released, now with code hints
along side completion.
